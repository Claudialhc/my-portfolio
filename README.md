# my-portfolio
This is my professional portfolio website. This is the first version of my portfolio, once I have more/actual experience I intend on adding those projects to this portfolio (in the mean time, please enjoy the images I have curated for you).

The whole website is composed of three main sub-sites, these sub-sites are: 
      <ul>
        <li>About Me</li>
        <li>Portfolio</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
      </ul>
<!-- this is just an example to see if it worked. Change before submitting hw -->
